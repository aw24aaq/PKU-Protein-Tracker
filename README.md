# 🍀PKU-Protein-Tracker - HTML

## What is PKU

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, causing it to accumulate to harmful levels and potentially lead to serious health issues if not managed.

## Why have i created this:

- I choose to complete this task because my sister has PKU. I asked her what kind of application would genuinely support her day‑to‑day needs, and she explained that she would like an app that helps her track her daily intake and review previous days. Her feedback directly informed the design and purpose of this project.

## To run this web / application, you will need:

- A laptop or an Android mobile device
- Access to the Google Chrome browser on both devices
- The ability to download and open the required file in Chrome on your mobile device

## Information about the web / application:

- When you enter your total daily intake, the percentage will automatically update based on how much you have consumed. For example, if your daily protein allowance is 10 g and you have used 4 g, the tracker will display that you have reached 40% of your daily limit.

## Next Steps 
 - Have the Application run on apple devices such as iphone and ipads.
